AGGREGATION 

user management api

-> how many users, signed up in the month of april 

User.find({date: $gt :{
    1/04/2025
}})


    I wanted a COUNT of users ->

        age range -> {
            age:20,
            users:10
        },
        age:30, count
        age:40
        age:50

        1. finding users by age 
        2. output format -> age, count 
        3. sorted 


        Insights / Analyse / Different format 

        Aggregation Queries 

        multiple conditions 
        -> information , range
        -> order
        -> format 
        -> count 

        product manager -> analyse the data and design the products 


        Facebook 

        -> gym bag 
            -> type -> age > 18 < 50 
            -> location : delhi
        
        -> email id 
        -> Rs.5000 -> 10,000

        Aggregation Queries 

        Pipelines

        Stagewise conditions 
        1. QUERY
        2. format
        3. limit 


        1. $match -> query match
        2. $group -> age wise users -> age basis groups -> age, count 
        3. project -> key:value
        4. sort -> ascending or descending
        5. limit and skip -> pagination
