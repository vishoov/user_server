api security best practices 

we are dealing with the data, and data is a very important asset
so we need to secure it
so for that, we are using API Security and Authentication 

1. Password Security -> Encryption - done
2. API Security -> User Authentication 
3. Server Security -> Server shield 
4. Rate Limiting -> to prevent Dos Attacks  - done
5. Environment Variables - done


mongoose error -> network access -> ip address add -> worked 

Rate Limiting 

npm i express-rate-limit

rate limiter -> limits the number of requests we can send to the server in a given
time bracket

Password Security
Encryption

the password needs to be encrypted -> even after if someone is accessing the data
    the password remains protected as it is stored in form of a random string 

"hellothere" -> "fohspoh90t4.,n/.ldhp9yp9hipugspigkfhjg"

Caesar's method 


Hash the password 


npm i bcrypt

bcrypt is used to HASH strings -> "hellothere" -> "fohspoh90t4.,n/.ldhp9yp9hipugspigkfhjg"

used 

userSchema.pre("save")

userschema method, prior to save event

password -> hashed password 


login 

compare -> hashed and user entered password



API Security 

token based system
