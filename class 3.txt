Databases, Models, Error Handing/Async 

Databases-> SQL and NoSqL, mongodb, atlas, compass

Asynchronous -> data depends on 3rd party 

Error handling -> unknown errors handle -> rather than crashing
                elegantly handle the error 



MongoDB -> install, mongoCompass -> database, collections 
    -> integrate in our project

Non -relational -> MAXIMUM LEVEL OPTIMIZATION 
        -> Data Validation
        -> Data Modelling
